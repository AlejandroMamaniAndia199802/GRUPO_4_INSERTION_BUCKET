# Insertion and bucket sort implementation in C++

## Overview

Sorting algorithms are widely studied in computer science courses, since its simplicity allow the student to understand the importance of algorithms. Furthermore, most computer tasks imply sorting a list of elements with a given sorting criteria. For this and more other reasons, they are an interesting object of study.

This repository was created as part of the course "Algorithms and Data Structures" taught in Universidad de Ingenería y Tecnología (aka UTEC). The objective of the homework assignment was/is to gain a depeer understanding on a given topic related to sorting algorithms. We (contributors) were given **insertion sort** and **bucĸet sort**.
